# Air Pollution Interpolation and Prediction
- This is the source code for the paper "Spatiotemporal deep learning model for citywide air pollution interpolation and prediction" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9070510).
- The dataset is large (~GB) so I will provide it by request to my contact in the paper.
